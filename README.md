# BMP File Parser
## Made By: Andy Liu

**Overview:**
A program that parses BMP files with the option to perform operations like scaling, changing brightness, and colour filtering. To use the program, download the repo as a zip file and unzip it. Then, open the Python file and choose one of the example BMP input files (or any input file) to use.

**Troubleshooting:**
You must have a working installation of python. You also need to have pip installed (Python's package installer). Make sure the packages numpy, Pillow, and tkinter are installed. If they are not installed, you can install them with these commands:

pip install numpy
pip install Pillow
pip install tkinter
